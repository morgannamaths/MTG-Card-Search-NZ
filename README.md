# MTG Card Search NZ
A python script that searches a wishlist of MTG cards on common New Zealand MTG card retailers.

## How to use
Open the _MTG Card Wishlist.txt_ file and write down what cards you want to search for, then save. Make sure there is no punctuation in the card names, such as commas or hyphens. Upper or lower case does not matter.

Then run _MTG Card Search.py_.

## Advanced
By default, the program will search https://www.shufflencutgames.co.nz. You can alter the "website" variable within _MTG Card Search NZ.py_ to select from a variety of pre-added websites, such as https://gamingdna.co.nz, https://cardmerchant.co.nz and https://goblingames.nz. Feel free to add your own websites.

Also by default is the use of firefox, executing it in the terminal using the os command. Feel free to change this too.

## Updates
### v1.1.0 - 18th December 2023 
Now uses the os command to execute the code, rather than having to manually open a terminal and alt-tabbing.
